# LinkedIn Post Generator

This project is an open-source LinkedIn post generator, powered by ChatGPT. It not only generates LinkedIn posts but also ranks them based on a unique algorithm that considers factors like hashtags, emojis, URLs, and more.

## Getting Started

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app. To get started:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`, `yarn install`, or `pnpm install`.
3. Run the development server using `npm run dev`, `yarn dev`, or `pnpm dev`.

Once the server is running, open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## API Routes

API routes can be accessed on http://localhost:3000/api/hello. This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`. The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.

## Custom Fonts

This project uses `next/font` to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
